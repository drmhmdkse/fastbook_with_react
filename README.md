# FastBook with React âš¡ðŸ“š

Hey there! Welcome to FastBook with React! We've cooked up this cool web app using React.js to help you read books way faster and smarter. So, if you're looking to pick up your reading pace, keep an eye on how you're doing, or even try out some speed reading tricks, FastBook's got your back!

## What's Cool About It?

-   **Speed Reading Goodies**: Wanna read like a flash? You can practice with timers you can change and text that lights up to guide you.
-   **Speak Your Language?**: Easily flip between different languages, like Turkish and English. No sweat!
-   **See Your Progress**: Check out how fast you're reading and look back at your reading history.
-   **Looks Great Everywhere**: It works smoothly whether you're on a big computer screen, a tablet, or your phone.
-   **Make It Yours**: Change up how it looks and feels with different themes and settings to make your reading super comfy.

## What's Under the Hood? (Tech Stuff)

-   **React.js**: This is what makes the app feel quick and snappy.
-   **i18next**: Helps us with all the language-switching magic.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: For making things look modern and work well on any screen size.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The main brain behind how everything works.

## Wanna Get It Running?

Just follow these easy steps to get the project set up on your computer.

### What You'll Need First:

Make sure you've got these things installed:

-   Node.js (version 14 or newer is best)
-   npm or yarn (these help you install stuff)
-   A modern web browser (like Chrome or Firefox)

### How to Install:

1.  **Grab the Code**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/drmhmdkse/fastbook_with_react.git](https://github.com/drmhmdkse/fastbook_with_react.git)
    cd fastbook_with_react
    ```

2.  **Install the Bits and Bobs**:
    If you're using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or if you prefer yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Fire It Up!**:
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```
    Then, you should see the app running at `http://localhost:3000`. Easy peasy!

## Tweaking Things

-   **Adding More Languages**: The app can speak multiple languages thanks to `i18next`. If you want to add new languages or change existing ones, just peek into the translation files in `src/locales/`.
-   **Secret Keys and Stuff**: If you need to add things like API keys or other special settings (maybe for a backend), just create a file named `.env` in the main project folder.

## How to Use It

1.  Open up the app in your browser (just go to `http://localhost:3000`).
2.  Pick a book or some text you want to read.
3.  Play around with the speed reading tools â€“ you can change the speed and turn on cool stuff like text highlighting.
4.  Want to switch languages? Just use the language toggle (you can choose Turkish or English, for example).
5.  Keep an eye on how you're doing in the dashboard.

## Want to Help Out?

We'd love for you to help make FastBook even more awesome! Hereâ€™s how you can jump in:

1.  Make a copy of the project (that's called "forking").
2.  Create a new branch for your cool new feature or bug fix:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-awesome-idea
    ```
3.  Make your changes and save them:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Here's what I did!"
    ```
4.  Send your changes up to your copy:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-awesome-idea
    ```
5.  Then, open a Pull Request on GitHub and tell us about your changes.

Just try to make sure your code fits in with how we've been doing things and add tests if you can. Thanks a bunch!
